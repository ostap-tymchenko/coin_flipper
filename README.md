<h3> coin-fliper </h3>

flips a coin however many times you want and tells you how many in a row of heads/tails you got.

edit line 21 ( #print("random number : ",binary_choise)) and get rid of the comment (#) to see the coin outputs in real time. (this slows down the program MASSIVLLY, i beleve O(n) vs O(n log n)
